  <summary>Organize media on the desktop</summary>
  <description>
    <p>The hydrus network client is a desktop application written for Anonymous and other internet enthusiasts with large media collections. It organises your files into an internal database and browses them with tags instead of folders, a little like a booru on your desktop. Tags and files can be anonymously shared through custom servers that any user may run. Everything is free, nothing phones home, and the source code is included with the release. It is developed mostly for Windows, but builds for Linux and macOS are available (perhaps with some limitations, depending on your situation).</p>
    <p>Currently importable filetypes are:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>images - jpg, gif (including animated), png (including animated!), tiff, webp, bmp</li>
        <li>video - webm, mp4, mpeg, avi, mov, mkv, flv, wmv</li>
        <li>audio - mp3, flac, ogg, wma</li>
        <li>misc - swf, pdf, psd, zip, rar, 7z</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The client can download files and parse tags from a number of websites, including by default:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>various imageboards, with a thread watcher</li>
        <li>the popular boorus</li>
        <li>gallery sites like deviant art, and pixiv</li>
        <li>tumblr and twitter</li>
    </ul>
    <p>And can be extended to download from more locations using easily shareable user-made downloaders. It can also be set to 'subscribe' to any gallery search, repeating it every few days to keep up with new results.</p>
    <p>The program's emphasis is on your freedom. There is no DRM, no spying, no censorship. The program never phones home.</p>

      <description>
        <p>Changes in Version 574</p>
        <ul>
          <li>The filetype selector in system:filetype now expands to eat extra vertical space if the dialog is resized</li>
          <li>The filetype selector in file import options is moved a bit and also now expands to eat extra vertical space</li>
          <li>Added a new 'apply image ICC Profile colour adjustments' checkbox to options->media. this simply turns off ICC profile loading and application, for debug purposes</li>
        </ul>

    <release version="573" date="2024-05-02">
      <url type="details">https://hydrusnetwork.github.io/hydrus/changelog.html#version_573</url>
      <description>
        <p>Changes in Version 573</p>
        <ul>
          <li>The archive/delete and duplicate filters now yes/no confirm when you say to 'forget' at the end of a filtering run</li>
          <li>The duplicate filter page now only allows you to set the search location to local file domains--so it'll only ever try to search and show pairs for files you actually have</li>
          <li>Refactored some question/button dialog stuff</li>
        </ul>

    <release version="571" date="2024-04-18">
      <url type="details">https://hydrusnetwork.github.io/hydrus/changelog.html#version_571</url>
      <description>
        <p>Changes in Version 571</p>
        <ul>
          <li>When you finish an archive/delete filter and there are several domains you could delete from, the 'commit' buttons are now disabled for 1.2 seconds. this catches you from accidentally spamming enter through a surprise complicated decision</li>
          <li>Under options->files and trash, you can now say 'when finishing filtering, always delete from all possible domains', which makes the above decision always single domain. hit this if you do want to spam through this and are fine always deleting from everywhere</li>
          <li>The client will now, by default, attempt to load truncated images. this was previously off until you set it per-session-on in a debug menu, but is now a checkbox under options->media. some weird damaged jpegs and pngs should now load, fingers crossed</li>
        </ul>

      <description>
        <p>Changes in Version 570</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Wrote a thing to wrap tooltips and applied it everywhere. every tooltip in the program should now wrap to 80 characters</li>
          <li>The thumbnail view is now better about pausing the current video if you open it externally in various ways</li>
          <li>The 'open' submenu you get off of a file right-click is now exactly the same for the thumbnail menu and the media viewer menu, with all commands working in either place, the labels are also brushed up a little</li>
        </ul>

      <description>
        <p>Changes in Version 568</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Thanks to a user, the new docx, pptx, and xlsx support is improved, with better thumbnails</li>
          <li>Thanks to a user, the cbz scanner now ignores the __MACOSX folder</li>
          <li>Thanks to a user, setting the Qt style in options->style should be more reliable (fixing some name case sensitivity issues)</li>

    <release version="566" date="2024-03-14">
      <url type="details">https://hydrusnetwork.github.io/hydrus/changelog.html#version_566</url>
      <description>
        <p>Changes in Version 566</p>
        <ul>
          <li>When you boot a 'manage tags' dialog on multiple files, a new Â± button now lets you do 'incremental tagging'. this is where you, let's say for twenty files, tag them from page:1->page:20. this has been a long time in the works, but now we have thumbnail reorganisation tech, it is now sensible to do.</li>
          <li>The dialog lets you set a namespace (or none), start point (e.g. you can start tagging at page:19 if you are doing the second chapter etc...), the step (you can count by +2 every file, instead of +1, or even -1 to decrement), the subtag prefix (so you can say 'page:insert-4' or something), and the subtag suffix (for, say, 'page:2 (wip)')</li>
          <li>The last namespace is remembered between dialog opens, and if the first file in the selection has a number tag in that namespace, that is the number the 'start' will initialise with. a bit of overlap/prep may save time here!</li>

        <p>Changes in Version 565</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Options->sort/collect now offers four places to customise default tag sort. instead of having one default sort for everything, there's now sort for search pages, media viewers, and the manage tags dialogs launched off of them</li>
          <li>When you copy namespaces from the tag filter list, it now copies the actual underlying data text like character:, which you can paste in elsewhere, rather than the pretty "character" tags display text</li>
          <li>Brushed up some of the UI and help text on the tag filter UI</li>

        <ul>
          <li>The system predicates for width, height, num_notes, num_words, num_urls, num_frames, duration, and framerate now support two different kinds of approximate equals, â: absolute (Â±x), and percentage (Â±x%)</li>
          <li>All system:framerate=x searches are now converted to Â±5%, which is what they were behind the scenes</li>
