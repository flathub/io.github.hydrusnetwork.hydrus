  <summary>Organize media on the desktop</summary>
  <description>
    <p>The hydrus network client is a desktop application written for Anonymous and other internet enthusiasts with large media collections. It organises your files into an internal database and browses them with tags instead of folders, a little like a booru on your desktop. Tags and files can be anonymously shared through custom servers that any user may run. Everything is free, nothing phones home, and the source code is included with the release. It is developed mostly for Windows, but builds for Linux and macOS are available (perhaps with some limitations, depending on your situation).</p>
    <p>Currently importable filetypes are:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>images - jpg, gif (including animated), png (including animated!), tiff, webp, bmp</li>
        <li>video - webm, mp4, mpeg, avi, mov, mkv, flv, wmv</li>
        <li>audio - mp3, flac, ogg, wma</li>
        <li>misc - swf, pdf, psd, zip, rar, 7z</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The client can download files and parse tags from a number of websites, including by default:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>various imageboards, with a thread watcher</li>
        <li>the popular boorus</li>
        <li>gallery sites like deviant art, and pixiv</li>
        <li>tumblr and twitter</li>
    </ul>
    <p>And can be extended to download from more locations using easily shareable user-made downloaders. It can also be set to 'subscribe' to any gallery search, repeating it every few days to keep up with new results.</p>
    <p>The program's emphasis is on your freedom. There is no DRM, no spying, no censorship. The program never phones home.</p>

        <p>Changes in Version 632</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            I did a v631a hotfix last week that fixed a looping network job(!!) under the particular
            conditions where a Post URL A1) used subsidiary parsers and failed to parse any URLs or,
            A2) did not parse anything generally, and B) had a certain environment, I think most
            probably ffmpeg version, that judged the respective html/json to not be potentially
            importable. I am very sorry for this problem and I thank the users who reported it and
            helped me test
          </li>
          <li>
            I added additional safety checks to the file and gallery import objects to stop this
            type of error happening again. if an import job works and produces no status change, it
            will now auto-veto with an appropriate note
          </li>
