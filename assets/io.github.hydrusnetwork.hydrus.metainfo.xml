  <summary>Organize media on the desktop</summary>
  <description>
    <p>The hydrus network client is a desktop application written for Anonymous and other internet enthusiasts with large media collections. It organises your files into an internal database and browses them with tags instead of folders, a little like a booru on your desktop. Tags and files can be anonymously shared through custom servers that any user may run. Everything is free, nothing phones home, and the source code is included with the release. It is developed mostly for Windows, but builds for Linux and macOS are available (perhaps with some limitations, depending on your situation).</p>
    <p>Currently importable filetypes are:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>images - jpg, gif (including animated), png (including animated!), tiff, webp, bmp</li>
        <li>video - webm, mp4, mpeg, avi, mov, mkv, flv, wmv</li>
        <li>audio - mp3, flac, ogg, wma</li>
        <li>misc - swf, pdf, psd, zip, rar, 7z</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The client can download files and parse tags from a number of websites, including by default:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>various imageboards, with a thread watcher</li>
        <li>the popular boorus</li>
        <li>gallery sites like deviant art, and pixiv</li>
        <li>tumblr and twitter</li>
    </ul>
    <p>And can be extended to download from more locations using easily shareable user-made downloaders. It can also be set to 'subscribe' to any gallery search, repeating it every few days to keep up with new results.</p>
    <p>The program's emphasis is on your freedom. There is no DRM, no spying, no censorship. The program never phones home.</p>

        <p>Changes in Version 639</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            system:number of tags and system:tag as number have a nicer new namespace selection widget
          </li>
          <li>
          fixed the duplicate filter group mode finding a new group after the previous group was resolved. I messed this up in last week's rewrite and it slipped through testing
          </li>
          <li>
            huge multi-column lists handle large selections much more efficiently, particularly when they have lots of buttons. all the various logic that handles 'should this accompanying button be enabled?' and so on now uses calls that work much faster when there are thousands of items selected. in my tests, a sublist with 5,000 test items now updates to a new selection in under 30ms--previously it was about a second. similarly, pasting all those items to a new list now takes about six seconds, whereas previously it was locking up for ages and ages, perhaps forever (issue #1737)
          </li>
          <li>
            fixed an issue where the 'move media files' dialog was saying all files were in their ideal location if the thumbnail location override was not set. this was happening because an error was being quashed over-eagerly. if this dialog has a similar problem in future, you might get some spammy reports, but it'll show. also a side thing, the 'set' button of the thumbnail location override no longer disables if you have a path set--feel free to move it to a new location in one step mate
          </li>
          <li>
            the system that positions windows off the topLeft corner of their parent is now more forgiving of unusual window manager frame geometry. if you kept getting 'hey I just rescued a window from ( 24, -14 )'-style popups every time you open the options off a maximised main GUI, let me know what happens now--are your dialogs appearing offscreen, auto-repositioning to (0, 0), or is everything good now?
          </li>
          <li>
            if you are feeling clever and can get an OR predicate into the duplicates auto-resolution 'test A or B' comparator, it now works! I'll brush up the UI in future to make it easy to enter an OR here (issue #1790)
          </li>
        </ul>
