  <summary>Organize media on the desktop</summary>
  <description>
    <p>The hydrus network client is a desktop application written for Anonymous and other internet enthusiasts with large media collections. It organises your files into an internal database and browses them with tags instead of folders, a little like a booru on your desktop. Tags and files can be anonymously shared through custom servers that any user may run. Everything is free, nothing phones home, and the source code is included with the release. It is developed mostly for Windows, but builds for Linux and macOS are available (perhaps with some limitations, depending on your situation).</p>
    <p>Currently importable filetypes are:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>images - jpg, gif (including animated), png (including animated!), tiff, webp, bmp</li>
        <li>video - webm, mp4, mpeg, avi, mov, mkv, flv, wmv</li>
        <li>audio - mp3, flac, ogg, wma</li>
        <li>misc - swf, pdf, psd, zip, rar, 7z</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The client can download files and parse tags from a number of websites, including by default:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>various imageboards, with a thread watcher</li>
        <li>the popular boorus</li>
        <li>gallery sites like deviant art, and pixiv</li>
        <li>tumblr and twitter</li>
    </ul>
    <p>And can be extended to download from more locations using easily shareable user-made downloaders. It can also be set to 'subscribe' to any gallery search, repeating it every few days to keep up with new results.</p>
    <p>The program's emphasis is on your freedom. There is no DRM, no spying, no censorship. The program never phones home.</p>

        <p>Changes in Version 634</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            hotfix
            I screwed up with a couple of bad typos in v633, and a couple bad bits of logic in the previous two weeks, so I ended up fixing it on Saturday and putting out a v633a hotfix. the full problems were--
            export folders doing work (issue #1775)
            setting forced filetypes
            the 'repair missing locations' pre-boot dialog
            the migrate files dialog when a path did not exist
            some weird webms
            sorry for the trouble and hassle--it looks like I just had some bad weeks recently and this just slipped through linting and my tests. I particularly regret export folders, since that isn't some super rare system, and I have written some a nicer unit tests to ensure they don't get hit by another stupid mistake like this
          </li>
          <li>
          inc/dec ratings
            thanks to a user, inc/dec ratings now grow to be as wide as they need to! this affects numbers over 999. their size options are now based on height rather than width (issue #1759)
          duplicates
            if the two 'jpeg quality' statements have the same label, e.g. 'high quality vs high quality', the score is now 0. previously, if the behind the scenes quality scores were 728 vs 731, it'd colour green and give points, which was confusing and over-confident
            last eek's ugly 'group mode' checkbox in the duplicates sidebar is now a scrollable menu button
