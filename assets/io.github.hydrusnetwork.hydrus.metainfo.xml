  <summary>Organize media on the desktop</summary>
  <description>
    <p>The hydrus network client is a desktop application written for Anonymous and other internet enthusiasts with large media collections. It organises your files into an internal database and browses them with tags instead of folders, a little like a booru on your desktop. Tags and files can be anonymously shared through custom servers that any user may run. Everything is free, nothing phones home, and the source code is included with the release. It is developed mostly for Windows, but builds for Linux and macOS are available (perhaps with some limitations, depending on your situation).</p>
    <p>Currently importable filetypes are:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>images - jpg, gif (including animated), png (including animated!), tiff, webp, bmp</li>
        <li>video - webm, mp4, mpeg, avi, mov, mkv, flv, wmv</li>
        <li>audio - mp3, flac, ogg, wma</li>
        <li>misc - swf, pdf, psd, zip, rar, 7z</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The client can download files and parse tags from a number of websites, including by default:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>various imageboards, with a thread watcher</li>
        <li>the popular boorus</li>
        <li>gallery sites like deviant art, and pixiv</li>
        <li>tumblr and twitter</li>
    </ul>
    <p>And can be extended to download from more locations using easily shareable user-made downloaders. It can also be set to 'subscribe' to any gallery search, repeating it every few days to keep up with new results.</p>
    <p>The program's emphasis is on your freedom. There is no DRM, no spying, no censorship. The program never phones home.</p>

        <p>Changes in Version 646</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            I made mpv safer, both in the existing recycle system and the create/destruction test. if you tried the mpv test last week and got hangs when flicking quickly or when leaving certain media viewers on an mpv window, please give it another go
          </li>
          <li>
          when pages load themselves initially, the individual file load jobs are split into different work packets for the worker pool, so a handful of big pages will no longer monopolise the queue. also, if a page is closed, the initial load pauses--if it is undo-reopened, initial load resumes
          </li>
          <li>
            in the duplicate filter, when the difference in import time is less than 30 days, the 'imported at similar time (unhelpful average timestamp)' label is replaced with 'a little newer/older than' (issue #1898)
          </li>
          <li>
            if you have a very large database, it now requires up to 5GB of free disk space on the db partition to boot (the cap was previously 512MB)
          </li>
          <li>
            the db disk space check now occurs on shutdown too. if you have less space than it thinks is safe, it warns you that shutdown may not save correctlly and you should immediately free up some space. you have the choice of backing out or going ahead (issue #1895)
          </li>
        </ul>
